## About Me

I'm a computational meteorologist with a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences, focused on applying meteorological data and machine learning to the energy sector. I have also an extensive experience in wind resource assessment in different corporate companies in leading positions.

I specialize in building end-to-end forecasting systems using meteorological data (ECMWF HRES, Subseasonal, Seasonal, DWD ICON-EU, ICON-D2, NOAA-GFS), bias correction methods by using hindcasts/reforecasts, and climate-energy indicators across Europe.

Currently, I work at **Vitus Commodities**, delivering operational wind, solar, and demand forecasts and weather related indexes for trading strategies — ranging from **hourly to seasonal timescales**.

## What I Work On

**Wind, Solar, Energy Demand Forecasts**  
Forecasting renewable energy sources and energy demand using ensemble and deterministic weather models.

**Energy Market Indices**  
Generating meteorological indexes spcealized for energy trading.

**Climate Indices**  
Climate model outputs and its impact on the energy markets.

**Energy Price & System Direction**  
Forecasting energy prices and the system's net direction which is essential for energy trading and reducing imbalance costs.
