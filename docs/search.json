    "text": "About Me\nI’m a computational meteorologist with a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences, focused on applying meteorological data and machine learning to the energy sector. I have also an extensive experience in wind resource assessment in different corporate companies in leading positions.\nI specialize in building end-to-end forecasting systems using meteorological data (ECMWF HRES, Subseasonal, Seasonal, DWD ICON-EU, ICON-D2, NOAA-GFS), bias correction methods by using hindcasts/reforecasts, and climate-energy indicators across Europe.\nCurrently, I work at Vitus Commodities, delivering operational wind, solar, and demand forecasts and weather related indexes for trading strategies — ranging from hourly to seasonal timescales."
